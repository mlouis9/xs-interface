Execute DYN3D (with 2D XS)
==========================

This notebook mimics a scenario where cross sections are read from 2-dim
files.

This Notebook demonestrates how to read cross sections from a serpent
``_res.m`` file, and write these cross sections using a template file.
In addition, this notebook shows how to execute DYN3D using the written
cross sections.

Case Description
----------------


Directory: ``.\xs-interface\xsInterface\jupyters\exe_dyn3d_2dim``

The ``.\inputs`` directory includes: - ``bwr_rho1_2gr`` a serpent input
file. This is a 3D BWR assembly divided into 36 layers (i.e., universes
1,2,â€¦,36) of fuel surrounded by a bottom (universe 54) and upper layers
(universe 55) of reflectors. **However, only u22, u54, and u55 are read
to mimic the active fuel and reflectors.** These cross sections are then
used to define 38 axial layers.

-  ``bwr_rho1_2gr_res.m`` a serpent results file with all the cross
   sections.
-  ``univs`` a file that describes how to read ``bwr_rho1_2gr_res.m``
-  ``template_dyn3d_2g`` is a template file that specifies how cross
   sections should be printed out.
-  ``controlDict`` the main files that is required by the
   ``xsInterface``.

The ``.\dyn3d`` includes a pre-generated DYN3D case. The ``.\dyn3d\xs``
directory will include all the files with printed cross sections
required by DYN3D.

Required imports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: 

    from xsInterface.functions.main import Main

.. code:: 

    # a class required to execute DYN3D
    from xsInterface.functions.dyn3d import DYN3D

.. code:: 

    # plotting capability
    from xsInterface.functions.plotters import Plot1d

.. code:: 

    inputFile = ".\\inputs\\controlDict"

Read the cross sections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: 

    # Reset the main object
    xs = Main(inputFile)


.. parsed-literal::

    ... Reading control dict ...
    <.\inputs\controlDict>
    
    

Read xs data without populating the templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: 

    # readTemplate allows to read and populate data using the templates
    xs.Read(readUniverses=True)


.. parsed-literal::

    SERPENT Serpent 2.1.32 found in .\inputs\bwr_rho1_2gr_res.m, but version 2.1.31 is defined in settings
      Attemping to read anyway. Please report strange behaviors/failures to developers.

    ... Reading coe/_res.m file for hisotry <nom> ...
    

Populate cross sections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the ``".\\inputs\\controlDict"`` the user defined the core map used
to populate the cross sections according to their channels and layers
positions.

In our problem we have 1 channel and 38 axial layers.

**Define states** These states must exist and be used to obtain the
cross sections for different channels and layers.

.. code:: 

    nchs, nlayers = 1, 3
    states = {
    'history':[['nom']*nlayers]*nchs, 'time': [[0.0]*nlayers]*nchs, 'dens': [[700.]*nlayers]*nchs,}

**Populate core data** built-in capability to populate the data
according to the defined map including defining new variables not listed
in the original ``univs`` file. This is a **mandaory** step if the
intent is to execute DYN3D.

.. code:: 

    volmanip = {'infflx': 'divide'}
    xs.PopulateCoreData(
                        states=states, 
                        attributes=None,  # specify only if specific attrs needed
                        volManip=volmanip,
                        adf=None, topadf=None, bottomadf=None)

Execute DYN3D
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: 

    casedir = ".\\dyn3d"   # dyn3d dir
    casefile = "bwr"  # name of dyn3d file
    exefile = "RUN_DYN3D" # dyn3d executuin file
    
    # Reset the object
    reslt = DYN3D(xs, casedir, casefile, exefile)

**Execute**

The files will be written to the specified directories and then
automatically executed.

.. code:: 

    reslt.Execute(printstatus=True)


.. parsed-literal::

    ... DYN3D Execution ... Start
    ... DYN3D Execution ... Ended Successfully
    

Process results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: 

    # eigenvalue
    reslt.keff




.. parsed-literal::

    1.329169



.. code:: 

    # few-group flux
    # reslt.flux

Process results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: 

    import numpy as np

The layers are defined as they were used in the actual problem

.. code:: 

    layers = np.linspace(0, 365.76, 37)  #active core
    layers = np.hstack((-20.0, layers, 385.76))  # with reflectors
    zmid = 0.5*(layers[0:-1] + layers[1:])

**Plot** axial distribution

.. code:: 

    # flux obtained by DYN3D
    dynFlux = np.array(reslt.flux)
    fastFlux = dynFlux[0, :, 0] / np.sum(dynFlux[0, :, 0])
    thermalFlux = dynFlux[0, :, 1] / np.sum(dynFlux[0, :, 1])

.. code:: 

    flx_profiles = {'Fast': dynFlux[0, :, 0],
              'Thermal': dynFlux[0, :, 1],}

Built-in 1-dim plotting capability

.. code:: 

    Plot1d(xvalues=zmid, yvalues=flx_profiles,
           markers=['--', '*'],
           xlabel="Height, cm", ylabel="DYN3D flux profiles")
